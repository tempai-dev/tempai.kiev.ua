# Rules of Japanese Mahjong #

[Mahjong][] (also spelled as Maah-Jongg, Majiang, etc) is an ancient Chinese game recognizable by a distinctive tile set used as the main object of the play, much like the chess game rules have become recognizable by the chess board and pieces used during the play.

Due to the respectable age, both the tile set of mahjong and the actual rules of play have evolved considerably; so nowadays they vary significantly between parts of the world. There are Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Australian, American and many other mahjong flavors, and they all vary drastically.

This is much like the differing rulesets of poker or billiards.

We play by [Japanese][Riichi] *Riichi* rules. Kuitan nashi, aka ari.
