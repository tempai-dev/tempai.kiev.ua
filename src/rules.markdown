# Rules of Japanese Mahjong #

[Mahjong][] is an ancient Chinese game recognizable by a distinctive tile set used as the main object of the play. Tiles for mahjong are what chess pieces are for chess.

The game is played by four people. <em>(There are tons of super-boring [solitaires][solitaire] about pairing mahjong tiles â€” they have to do with the actual game of mahjong as much as Klondike has to do with poker).</em> The winning objective is to form a structured hand of 14 tiles by means of drawing tiles, grouping them into forms, discarding tiles, and taking advantage of other players' discards.

Due to the respectable age, both the tile set and the actual rules of play have evolved considerably; nowadays they vary from one parts of the world to another. There are Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Australian, American and many other mahjong flavors, and they vary drastically. This is much like the different rulesets of poker or billiards.
